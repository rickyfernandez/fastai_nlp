      "negative,\"Un-bleeping-believable! Meg Ryan doesn't even look her usual pert lovable self in this, which normally makes me forgive her shallow ticky acting schtick. Hard to believe she was the producer on this dog. Plus Kevin Kline: what kind of suicide trip has his career been on? Whoosh... Banzai!!! Finally this was directed by the guy who did Big Chill? Must be a replay of Jonestown - hollywood style. Wooofff!\",False\r\n",
      "positive,\"This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it's also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"\"Mr & Mrs Iyer\"\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.\",False\r\n",
      "negative,\"Every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that I feel compelled to warn people. If I labor all my days and I can save but one soul from watching this movie, how great will be my joy.<br /><br />Where to begin my discussion of pain. For starters, there was a musical montage every five minutes. There was no character development. Every character was a stereotype. We had swearing guy, fat guy who eats donuts, goofy foreign guy, etc. The script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot. The production value was so incredibly low that it felt like I was watching a junior high video presentation. Have the directors, producers, etc. ever even seen a movie before? Halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry. The concept for this movie sounded so funny. How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors. But trust me when I say this, things went wrong, VERY WRONG.\",False\r\n",
      "positive,\"Name just says it all. I watched this movie with my dad when it came out and having served in Korea he had great admiration for the man. The disappointing thing about this film is that it only concentrate on a short period of the man's life - interestingly enough the man's entire life would have made such an epic bio-pic that it is staggering to imagine the cost for production.<br /><br />Some posters elude to the flawed characteristics about the man, which are cheap shots. The theme of the movie \"\"Duty, Honor, Country\"\" are not just mere words blathered from the lips of a high-brassed officer - it is the deep declaration of one man's total devotion to his country.<br /><br />Ironically Peck being the liberal that he was garnered a better understanding of the man. He does a great job showing the fearless general tempered with the humane side of the man.\",False\r\n",
      "negative,\"This movie succeeds at being one of the most unique movies you've seen. However this comes from the fact that you can't make heads or tails of this mess. It almost seems as a series of challenges set up to determine whether or not you are willing to walk out of the movie and give up the money you just paid. If you don't want to feel slighted you'll sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved, they've all seen better days, but then you realize they actually got paid quite a bit of money to do this and you'll lose pity for them just like you've already done for the film. I can't go on enough about this horrible movie, its almost something that Ed Wood would have made and in that case it surely would have been his masterpiece.<br /><br />To start you are forced to sit through an opening dialogue the likes of which you've never seen/heard, this thing has got to be five minutes long. On top of that it is narrated, as to suggest that you the viewer cannot read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the barrage of terrible lines gets underway, it is as if he is operating solely to get lines on to the movie poster tag line. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, who I typically enjoy) and he does his best not to drown in this but ultimately he does. Then comes the ultimate insult, Tara Reid playing an intelligent role, oh help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she continually gets roles in movies, in my opinion though she should stick to movies of the American pie type. <br /><br />All in all you just may want to see this for yourself when it comes out on video, I know that I got a kick out of it, I mean lets all be honest here, sometimes its comforting to revel in the shortcomings of others.\",False\r\n",
      "negative,\"From the start, you know how this movie will end. It's so full of clich√©s your typical NRA member will not even like this movie. I give it 2 out of 10, only because of the acting of William Benton. I can't believe people voted 6+ for this movie. It's so biased towards a 'certain point of view' (once a thief...). People aren't born bad. Neither are they born good. They are born with a clean slate. It's society, parents and education what makes them who they are. And if they take the wrong turn, somewhere down the line, it certainly isn't going to be the American penal system that gets them back on track! Anyway, avoid this movie like the plague. I bet you have better things to do with your time than waste it on this piece of crap.<br /><br />\",False\r\n",
      "negative,\"There were a lot of truly great horror movies produced in the seventies - but this film certainly isn't one of them! It's a shame The Child isn't better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes. We have the idea of a vengeful child, which worked so well in classic films such as The Bad Seed and then we have the central zombie theme, which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie. The plot is basically this: young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother, so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge (as you do). This is all well and good, except for the fact that it's boring! Nothing happens for most of the film, and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore; it's not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it. The film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish. There's really not much I can say about the film overall as there isn't much to it. The Child is a dismal seventies horror flick and I certainly don't recommend it.\",False\r\n",
      "negative,\"I was fortunate enough to meet George Pal (and still have my DS:TMOB poster autographed by him) at a convention shortly after the release, and asked him why he chose to do the film \"\"camp\"\". Before he could answer, two studio flacks intercepted and lectured me on how the studio \"\"knew best\"\" and how \"\"no one will take such a film seriously\"\". I had been reading the Bantam reprints for a couple of years thanks to a friend (ComiCon attendees of the 1970s will recall Blackhawk and his band? I was in a couple of years of that with him), and had higher hopes than what we got.<br /><br />The flacks insisted that no high adventure would ever be done seriously, and so doing 'camp' was the only way. Several other fans jumped in on my side, with Pal listening as best he could. At the end of the little event, Pal came up to us and apologized, wishing he could have done more and better.<br /><br />STAR WARS put the lie to the flacks, and a year after Pal's death, Spielberg and Lucas proved that Doc Savage could have easily been the next major movie franchise...if it hadn't been for the flacks.<br /><br />Tear out the memory or history of Doc, and the film would have been worth a 6/10 rating as nothing more than a mindless popcorn seller.<br /><br />But destroying the legacy like that was no less an abomination than killing a baby in the crib.<br /><br />Doc Savage can still come to the screen, and survive the inevitable comparisons by the ill-informed to Indiana Jones, but it would have to be done in all seriousness and earnest to reclaim the glory that we should expect from the First American Superhero.<br /><br />SIDENOTES: Yes, there was a second script for ARCHENEMY OF EVIL, and it's a lot more serious. Yes, there was simultaneous footage shot, but mostly establishing shots and very little with actors. And, yes, there _is_ a one-sheet of Ron Ely leaping over a brick wall and blasting at something over his shoulder with a specially built bronze pistol. Ely's wearing a duster over a button down white shirt with a bronze tie, and the words \"\"DOC SAVAGE: ARCHENEMY OF EVIL...Coming Next Summer!\"\" POSTSCRIPT: If anyone knows who the studio flacks were that accompanied George Pal in 1975 to San Diego for the convention, smack the idiots up the side of the head and call them the idiots that they are. At the time, they were doing dorkknobs and Fu Manchu in stripes and baggy canvas pants, and carrying Paramount portfolios.\",False\r\n",
      "negative,\"This film is the freshman effort of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. While it suffers from a few problems, as every low budget production does, it is a good start for Ms. Beaton and her company.<br /><br />The story is not terribly new having been done in films like The Burning and every Friday the 13th since part 2. But, the performances are heartfelt. So many big budget movies just have the actors going through the motions, its always nice to see actors really trying to hone their craft.<br /><br />The story deals with the murder(and possible return) of a disfigured classmate. The others are sworn to secrecy, but the trauma of the event sends each person in different directions in their lifes. Ten years later, the friends are murdered one by one by a gruesome stalker known as \"\"The Bagman\"\". Who will survive? You have to watch.<br /><br />If you are Roger Ebert or any number of arrogant critics, you probably shouldn't bother. But if your taste run more towards Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people honing their craft, then check out \"\"The Bagman\"\".\",False\r\n"

       "xxbos i have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty , and i can honestly say i feel violated . i had read the reviews and heard the warnings , and i thought i was prepared for anything - at best i thought , a faithful ( if misguided ) attempt at an original adaptation ; at worst , a so - good - xxunk - bad \" xxmaj plan 9 \" for the new millennium . xxmaj so when i managed to pick up a copy in xxmaj walmart while in xxmaj florida and brought it back to the xxup uk , i joked to my friends \" xxmaj prepare for the worst movie ever made ! \" xxmaj oh , cruel xxmaj karma . xxmaj there is absolutely xxup nothing to recommend this film . xxmaj the \" special \" effects look like the work of a first year design student using a xxmaj xxunk xxup xxunk . xxmaj the acting is terrible , the accents are xxup worse than terrible ( one artillery xxunk ' accent seems to take us on a tour of the xxmaj british xxmaj xxunk , from xxmaj scotland to xxmaj xxunk via xxmaj xxunk xxmaj ireland ) , the dialogue is stilted , the editing is non - existent , the production values prove that no expense has been gone to . xxmaj words really can not describe how bad this movie is ; from the xxmaj union xxmaj flag flying from the horribly xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( the xxmaj royal xxmaj navy flies the xxmaj white xxmaj xxunk , xxup not the xxmaj union flag ) to the xxunk ridden acting , this is quite simply a crime against film making . xxmaj when you consider some of the literally - zero - budget fan films that are available on the ' net ( the xxmaj star xxmaj wars short \" xxmaj troops \" for example ) , the whole \" we 're xxunk amateurs \" argument goes right out of the window . xxmaj and if you believe an interview with xxmaj hines on the xxmaj xxunk website , this film had an 8 figure budget ! i can only assume that xxunk facial hair does not come cheap in the xxup us . xxmaj maybe the problem is that xxmaj hines & co tried to make a film of the book , rather than turn the book into a film ( if that makes any sense ) . xxmaj characters and extras spout chunks of text xxunk without trying to convey the feelings behind the words . xxmaj ironically enough , the xxup only person who even came close to giving a decent performance was xxmaj darlene xxmaj sellers , the ex - soft porn actress . xxmaj my advice ? xxmaj pray like crazy that xxmaj jeff xxmaj wayne does n't screw up , and go watch the xxmaj spielberg version . xxmaj it may not be true to the text of the book , but i can say this ; xxmaj as a lifelong xxup hg xxmaj wells fan ( and xxmaj xxunk as well ) xxmaj xxunk film xxup is true to the xxmaj spirit of the book . xxmaj maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country , but i will say this : xxmaj timothy xxmaj hines stole three hours of my life , and i want them back .,xxbos xxmaj this film is brilliant ! xxmaj it touches everyone who sees it in an extraordinary way . xxmaj it really takes you back to your youth and puts a new perspective on how you view your childhood memories . xxmaj there are so many xxunk to this film . xxmaj it is innovative and absolutely fabulous !,xxbos i rented this shortly after renting xxmaj ben xxmaj stein 's \" xxmaj expelled \" and thought it would interesting to compare them . xxmaj before i go further , it seems only fair that i point out the following so a reader can see if i 'm xxunk or not . i 'm trying to be objective , for the record . \n",
       " \n",
       "  i tend to enjoy xxmaj maher 's xxup xxunk show now and then , though i rarely think he 's the source of the humor . i do n't really care for his stand - up either . xxmaj but he makes some good points on the show now and again , and i liked xxmaj politically xxmaj incorrect , though he was still fairly politically correct ( which i deem a negative because the very term sounds xxmaj orwellian or at least fascist ) . xxmaj as for my religious views , i 'll say for simplicity 's sake that i 'm a non - xxunk . xxmaj christian with some views that are xxunk and some that are agnostic mixed in . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj that being said , this a bad \" documentary \" for reasons that have n't been touched on yet by many reviewers -- though the ones mentioned are xxunk too . xxmaj the reason it 's not convincing is n't just that he argues the main point without letting others talk ( and his point boils down to nothing logical either , it 's just \" come on , really ? \" which is n't a point , just a question . xxmaj try xxmaj david xxmaj xxunk if you want a decent argument . ) . xxmaj the reason this is n't convincing lies in his lack of experts on the subject matter . i saw this about 2 months ago and i only recall him talking to one person whose credentials as a professional were mentioned if he was n't a xxunk . xxmaj there are probably hundreds of scientists or at least professors with xxmaj masters or xxmaj xxunk willing to do a bit of xxunk xxunk , particularly in the fields of xxmaj history , xxmaj xxunk or a host of others . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj if one compares this to xxmaj ben xxmaj stein 's \" xxmaj expelled : xxmaj no xxmaj intelligence xxmaj allowed \" he 'll find that xxmaj stein interviews about 30 xxunk professors , professionals , xxunk , etc . xxmaj he does this with a variety of sources with various backgrounds . xxmaj he also makes a point in his film regarding freedom of thought and education . xxmaj maher could easily have pointed out wrongs committed by xxunk rules throughout centuries or xxunk from this . xxmaj instead he xxunk refers to the 20th century 's secular totalitarian xxunk as evidence of why xxunk needs more socio - political power xxrep 4 ! ( it 's in the bonus features where he 's standing in front of the xxmaj anne xxmaj frank house i think . ) xxmaj this is a true xxmaj orwellian head - trip . xxmaj he blames xxmaj christianity in particular on many pointless deaths -- which has had its share , though far smaller than xxunk even including a basic view of the evidence . xxmaj perhaps this is because that argument is xxunk by secular xxunk 's miserable record of the 20th xxmaj century xxup alone . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj another glaring weakness is his xxunk to talk to anyone that would be considered a moderate or \" average \" xxunk . xxmaj he picks out the weakest xxunk of the xxunk . xxmaj how difficult is that ? xxmaj how does proving the existence of exceptions move toward xxunk the general rule ? xxmaj it does not . xxmaj wow , so people in xxunk think outside of the norm ? xxmaj how enlightening to know this . xxmaj great work xxmaj maher ! xxmaj again , it would be fairly easy to interview someone like xxmaj laurence xxmaj vance and include his work on xxunk the idea of \" patriotic duty \" that demands a person fight in any war his country is involved in . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj beyond all that , he 's just not that funny here . xxmaj some of the clips that are xxunk in \" clever \" out of context / irreverent ways might garner a laugh , but mostly work to illustrate how a real contextual argument from xxmaj maher will xxup not be xxunk , much less convincing . xxmaj he spends most of his time bashing xxmaj xxunk , xxunk inaccuracies , and interviewing xxunk groups that he does n't allow to really answer his questions . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj for the record , there are good questions to honestly ask of religious folks and many they should ask of themselves . xxmaj he touches on almost none of these . i get the feeling that i could 've xxunk much better to most of his questioning than the people he interviewed , but the whole thing reeks of deck - stacking in terms of what is included and what was edited out .,xxbos xxmaj xxunk was great with xxmaj million $ xxmaj hotel . i do n't know how he came up with this film ! xxmaj the idea of giving the situation after xxunk and the view of xxmaj american xxmaj society is xxunk , that makes it 2 out of ten . xxmaj but this is not a movie . xxmaj is that the best someone can do with a great xxunk west - east xxunk are important things going on in middle east and it is just xxunk on the screen of a xxup mac * with the fingers of an xxmaj xxunk girl who is actually at the level of xxunk she is just ignorant about the xxunk characters are not well shaped . xxmaj and the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me . xxmaj at the ending scene xxmaj xxunk says lets just be quiet and try to listen . xxmaj and the background music says \" ... i will xxunk . xxmaj the thing is not about religion actually . xxmaj but it ends up with this . xxmaj how you are gon na see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray . xxmaj the lights are already shining on the truth . xxmaj its just that nobody wants to see it . ps : \" xxmaj my home is not a place . xxmaj it is xxunk only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence . xxmaj but it is wasted behind this film making . ( by the way ; as \" someone \" mentioned below , xxmaj xxunk finest young man are not finest , they are just the \" poor \" and the \" hopeless \" ones who sign up for the army in need of good paychecks which is not provided by the government ! ),xxbos xxmaj this movie is so bad , i knew how it ends right after this little girl killed the first person . xxmaj very bad acting very bad plot very bad movie \n",

       "xxbos i have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty , and i can honestly say i feel violated . i had read the reviews and heard the warnings , and i thought i was prepared for anything - at best i thought , a faithful ( if misguided ) attempt at an original adaptation ; at worst , a so - good - xxunk - bad \" xxmaj plan 9 \" for the new millennium . xxmaj so when i managed to pick up a copy in xxmaj walmart while in xxmaj florida and brought it back to the xxup uk , i joked to my friends \" xxmaj prepare for the worst movie ever made ! \" xxmaj oh , cruel xxmaj karma . xxmaj there is absolutely xxup nothing to recommend this film . xxmaj the \" special \" effects look like the work of a first year design student using a xxmaj xxunk xxup xxunk . xxmaj the acting is terrible , the accents are xxup worse than terrible ( one artillery xxunk ' accent seems to take us on a tour of the xxmaj british xxmaj xxunk , from xxmaj scotland to xxmaj xxunk via xxmaj xxunk xxmaj ireland ) , the dialogue is stilted , the editing is non - existent , the production values prove that no expense has been gone to . xxmaj words really can not describe how bad this movie is ; from the xxmaj union xxmaj flag flying from the horribly xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( the xxmaj royal xxmaj navy flies the xxmaj white xxmaj xxunk , xxup not the xxmaj union flag ) to the xxunk ridden acting , this is quite simply a crime against film making . xxmaj when you consider some of the literally - zero - budget fan films that are available on the ' net ( the xxmaj star xxmaj wars short \" xxmaj troops \" for example ) , the whole \" we 're xxunk amateurs \" argument goes right out of the window . xxmaj and if you believe an interview with xxmaj hines on the xxmaj xxunk website , this film had an 8 figure budget ! i can only assume that xxunk facial hair does not come cheap in the xxup us . xxmaj maybe the problem is that xxmaj hines & co tried to make a film of the book , rather than turn the book into a film ( if that makes any sense ) . xxmaj characters and extras spout chunks of text xxunk without trying to convey the feelings behind the words . xxmaj ironically enough , the xxup only person who even came close to giving a decent performance was xxmaj darlene xxmaj sellers , the ex - soft porn actress . xxmaj my advice ? xxmaj pray like crazy that xxmaj jeff xxmaj wayne does n't screw up , and go watch the xxmaj spielberg version . xxmaj it may not be true to the text of the book , but i can say this ; xxmaj as a lifelong xxup hg xxmaj wells fan ( and xxmaj xxunk as well ) xxmaj xxunk film xxup is true to the xxmaj spirit of the book . xxmaj maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country , but i will say this : xxmaj timothy xxmaj hines stole three hours of my life , and i want them back .,xxbos xxmaj this film is brilliant ! xxmaj it touches everyone who sees it in an extraordinary way . xxmaj it really takes you back to your youth and puts a new perspective on how you view your childhood memories . xxmaj there are so many xxunk to this film . xxmaj it is innovative and absolutely fabulous !,xxbos i rented this shortly after renting xxmaj ben xxmaj stein 's \" xxmaj expelled \" and thought it would interesting to compare them . xxmaj before i go further , it seems only fair that i point out the following so a reader can see if i 'm xxunk or not . i 'm trying to be objective , for the record . \n",
       " \n",
       "  i tend to enjoy xxmaj maher 's xxup xxunk show now and then , though i rarely think he 's the source of the humor . i do n't really care for his stand - up either . xxmaj but he makes some good points on the show now and again , and i liked xxmaj politically xxmaj incorrect , though he was still fairly politically correct ( which i deem a negative because the very term sounds xxmaj orwellian or at least fascist ) . xxmaj as for my religious views , i 'll say for simplicity 's sake that i 'm a non - xxunk . xxmaj christian with some views that are xxunk and some that are agnostic mixed in . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj that being said , this a bad \" documentary \" for reasons that have n't been touched on yet by many reviewers -- though the ones mentioned are xxunk too . xxmaj the reason it 's not convincing is n't just that he argues the main point without letting others talk ( and his point boils down to nothing logical either , it 's just \" come on , really ? \" which is n't a point , just a question . xxmaj try xxmaj david xxmaj xxunk if you want a decent argument . ) . xxmaj the reason this is n't convincing lies in his lack of experts on the subject matter . i saw this about 2 months ago and i only recall him talking to one person whose credentials as a professional were mentioned if he was n't a xxunk . xxmaj there are probably hundreds of scientists or at least professors with xxmaj masters or xxmaj xxunk willing to do a bit of xxunk xxunk , particularly in the fields of xxmaj history , xxmaj xxunk or a host of others . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj if one compares this to xxmaj ben xxmaj stein 's \" xxmaj expelled : xxmaj no xxmaj intelligence xxmaj allowed \" he 'll find that xxmaj stein interviews about 30 xxunk professors , professionals , xxunk , etc . xxmaj he does this with a variety of sources with various backgrounds . xxmaj he also makes a point in his film regarding freedom of thought and education . xxmaj maher could easily have pointed out wrongs committed by xxunk rules throughout centuries or xxunk from this . xxmaj instead he xxunk refers to the 20th century 's secular totalitarian xxunk as evidence of why xxunk needs more socio - political power xxrep 4 ! ( it 's in the bonus features where he 's standing in front of the xxmaj anne xxmaj frank house i think . ) xxmaj this is a true xxmaj orwellian head - trip . xxmaj he blames xxmaj christianity in particular on many pointless deaths -- which has had its share , though far smaller than xxunk even including a basic view of the evidence . xxmaj perhaps this is because that argument is xxunk by secular xxunk 's miserable record of the 20th xxmaj century xxup alone . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj another glaring weakness is his xxunk to talk to anyone that would be considered a moderate or \" average \" xxunk . xxmaj he picks out the weakest xxunk of the xxunk . xxmaj how difficult is that ? xxmaj how does proving the existence of exceptions move toward xxunk the general rule ? xxmaj it does not . xxmaj wow , so people in xxunk think outside of the norm ? xxmaj how enlightening to know this . xxmaj great work xxmaj maher ! xxmaj again , it would be fairly easy to interview someone like xxmaj laurence xxmaj vance and include his work on xxunk the idea of \" patriotic duty \" that demands a person fight in any war his country is involved in . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj beyond all that , he 's just not that funny here . xxmaj some of the clips that are xxunk in \" clever \" out of context / irreverent ways might garner a laugh , but mostly work to illustrate how a real contextual argument from xxmaj maher will xxup not be xxunk , much less convincing . xxmaj he spends most of his time bashing xxmaj xxunk , xxunk inaccuracies , and interviewing xxunk groups that he does n't allow to really answer his questions . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj for the record , there are good questions to honestly ask of religious folks and many they should ask of themselves . xxmaj he touches on almost none of these . i get the feeling that i could 've xxunk much better to most of his questioning than the people he interviewed , but the whole thing reeks of deck - stacking in terms of what is included and what was edited out .,xxbos xxmaj xxunk was great with xxmaj million $ xxmaj hotel . i do n't know how he came up with this film ! xxmaj the idea of giving the situation after xxunk and the view of xxmaj american xxmaj society is xxunk , that makes it 2 out of ten . xxmaj but this is not a movie . xxmaj is that the best someone can do with a great xxunk west - east xxunk are important things going on in middle east and it is just xxunk on the screen of a xxup mac * with the fingers of an xxmaj xxunk girl who is actually at the level of xxunk she is just ignorant about the xxunk characters are not well shaped . xxmaj and the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me . xxmaj at the ending scene xxmaj xxunk says lets just be quiet and try to listen . xxmaj and the background music says \" ... i will xxunk . xxmaj the thing is not about religion actually . xxmaj but it ends up with this . xxmaj how you are gon na see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray . xxmaj the lights are already shining on the truth . xxmaj its just that nobody wants to see it . ps : \" xxmaj my home is not a place . xxmaj it is xxunk only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence . xxmaj but it is wasted behind this film making . ( by the way ; as \" someone \" mentioned below , xxmaj xxunk finest young man are not finest , they are just the \" poor \" and the \" hopeless \" ones who sign up for the army in need of good paychecks which is not provided by the government ! ),xxbos xxmaj this movie is so bad , i knew how it ends right after this little girl killed the first person . xxmaj very bad acting very bad plot very bad movie \n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj but it is hard to watch , because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented . xxmaj it is now xxunk to blame the xxmaj british for setting xxmaj hindus and xxmaj muslims against each other , and then xxunk xxunk them into two countries . xxmaj there is some merit in this view , but it 's also true that no one forced xxmaj hindus and xxmaj muslims in the region to xxunk each other as they did around the time of partition . xxmaj it seems more likely that the xxmaj british simply saw the xxunk between the xxunk and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen . xxmaj but it is never painted as a black - and - white case . xxmaj there is xxunk and xxunk on both sides , and also the hope for change in the younger generation . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj there is redemption of a sort , in the end , when xxmaj xxunk has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life , but also truly loved her , and her family which has xxunk her , then later come looking for her . xxmaj but by that point , she has no xxunk that is without great pain for her . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj this film carries the message that both xxmaj muslims and xxmaj hindus have their grave xxunk , and also that both can be xxunk and caring people . xxmaj the reality of partition makes that xxunk all the more wrenching , since there can never be real xxunk across the xxmaj india / xxmaj pakistan border . xxmaj in that sense , it is similar to \" xxmaj mr & xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk \" . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj in the end , we were glad to have seen the film , even though the resolution was xxunk . xxmaj if the xxup uk and xxup us could deal with their own xxunk of racism with this kind of xxunk , they would certainly be better off .,xxbos xxmaj every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that i feel compelled to warn people . xxmaj if i labor all my days and i can save but one soul from watching this movie , how great will be my joy . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj where to begin my discussion of pain . xxmaj for xxunk , there was a musical xxunk every five minutes . xxmaj there was no character development . xxmaj every character was a stereotype . xxmaj we had xxunk guy , fat guy who eats donuts , goofy foreign guy , etc . xxmaj the script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot . xxmaj the production value was so incredibly low that it felt like i was watching a junior high video presentation . xxmaj have the directors , producers , etc . ever even seen a movie before ? xxmaj xxunk is getting worse and worse with every new entry . xxmaj the concept for this movie sounded so funny . xxmaj how could you go wrong with xxmaj gary xxmaj coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors . xxmaj but trust me when i say this , things went wrong , xxup very xxup wrong .,xxbos xxmaj name just says it all . i watched this movie with my dad when it came out and having served in xxmaj xxunk he had great admiration for the man . xxmaj the disappointing thing about this film is that it only xxunk on a short period of the man 's life - interestingly enough the man 's entire life would have made such an epic bio - xxunk that it is staggering to imagine the cost for production . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj some posters xxunk to the flawed xxunk about the man , which are cheap shots . xxmaj the theme of the movie \" xxmaj duty , xxmaj honor , xxmaj country \" are not just mere words xxunk from the lips of a high - xxunk officer - it is the deep xxunk of one man 's total devotion to his country . \n",

       "  xxmaj ironically xxmaj xxunk being the liberal that he was xxunk a better understanding of the man . xxmaj he does a great job showing the xxunk general xxunk with the xxunk side of the man .,xxbos xxmaj this movie succeeds at being one of the most unique movies you 've seen . xxmaj however this comes from the fact that you ca n't make heads or xxunk of this mess . xxmaj it almost seems as a series of challenges set up to determine whether or not you are willing to walk out of the movie and give up the money you just paid . xxmaj if you do n't want to feel xxunk you 'll sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved , they 've all seen better days , but then you realize they actually got paid quite a bit of money to do this and you 'll lose pity for them just like you 've already done for the film . i ca n't go on enough about this horrible movie , its almost something that xxmaj ed xxmaj wood would have made and in that case it surely would have been his masterpiece . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj to start you are forced to sit through an opening dialogue the likes of which you 've never seen / heard , this thing has got to be five minutes long . xxmaj on top of that it is narrated , as to suggest that you the viewer can not read . xxmaj then we meet xxmaj mr. xxmaj xxunk and the xxunk of terrible lines gets xxunk , it is as if he is xxunk solely to get lines on to the movie poster xxunk line . xxmaj soon we meet xxmaj stephen xxmaj xxunk , who i typically enjoy ) and he does his best not to drown in this but ultimately he does . xxmaj then comes the ultimate insult , xxmaj tara xxmaj xxunk playing an intelligent role , oh help us ! xxmaj tara xxmaj xxunk is not a very talented actress and somehow she xxunk gets roles in movies , in my opinion though she should stick to movies of the xxmaj american pie type . \n",
